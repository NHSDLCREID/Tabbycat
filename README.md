# Tabbycat

Tabbycat is a draw tabulation system for 3 vs 3 debating tournaments. It was used at Auckland Australs 2010, [Victoria Australs 2012](http://australs2012.com) and [Otago Australs 2014](http://australs2014.com).

Our **demo site** is at http://tabbycatdebate.herokuapp.com/. It's normally up, but its form will vary from time to time as we set up new feature demos for people. If it's down and you'd like to see it, or if you want to play with it as if you were running a tournament, contact us (details below). To see a post-tournament website, have a look at the Otago Australs 2014 tab website at http://tab.australs2014.com/.

#### Something missing?

The system's currently optimized for Australs, but we're developing for all two-team formats. So if your tournament has different requirements to what we have (say, different draw rules or number of speakers), odds are we've already thought about it and it's on the [to-do list](https://github.com/czlee/tabbycat/issues).

That said, our to-do list is long. **We prioritise our work by the features that will be used first.** So if you're planning to use it for a tournament but need some changes, please don't be shyâ€”get in touch with us (below) and we'll be more than happy to help. Please don't just wait for us to implement your requirement: we'd rather have the real-time feedback about which features are most useful!
 
## Installation and user guide

## Licensing, development and contact

We're happy to help if you have any questions (contact below) or feature requests (see [above](#something-missing)), though obviously we provide no warranty and disclaim all legal liability.
