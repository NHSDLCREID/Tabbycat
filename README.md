[![Docs](https://readthedocs.org/projects/tabbycat/badge/?version=latest)](http://tabbycat.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)  [![Docs](https://readthedocs.org/projects/tabbycat/badge/?version=stable)](http://tabbycat.readthedocs.org/en/stable/) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/czlee/tabbycat.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/czlee/tabbycat)

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

Tabbycat is a draw tabulation system for 3 vs 3 debating tournaments. It was used at Auckland Australs 2010, [Victoria Australs 2012](https://www.facebook.com/Australs2012), Otago Australs 2014, Daejeon Australs 2015 among many other tournaments of all sizes.

Our **demo site** is at [tabbycatdebate.herokuapp.com](http://tabbycatdebate.herokuapp.com/). It is normally up, but its form will vary from time to time as we set up new feature demos for people. If it is down and you would like to see it, or if you want to play with it as if you were running a tournament, [contact us](#authors-and-contacts). To see a post-tournament website, have a look at the [Daejeon Australs 2015 tab website](http://tab.australasians2015.org).

## Features

- Enter data from multiple computers simultaneously
- Easily deployable to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) for a fast and free setup
- Automated adjudicator allocations based on adjudicator ranking, room importance, and conflicts
- A drag and drop interface for adjudicator allocation that automatically displays conflicts alongside gender and regional balance
- A fully responsive design that automatically adapts to suit large screens, laptops, tablets, and phones
- Configurable draw generation rules and support for Australs and NZ team standings rules
- Confiugrable adjudicator feedback questions and optional online submission of feedback and scoresheets
- Optional online post-tournament tab display

Tabbycat is currently optimized for Australs, but we are developing for all two-team formats. So if your tournament has different requirements to what we have (say, different draw rules or number of speakers), odds are we have already thought about it and it is on the [to-do list](https://github.com/czlee/tabbycat/issues).

That said, our to-do list is long. **We prioritise our work by the features that will be used first.** So if you are planning to use it for a tournament but need some changes, please do not be shyâ€”[get in touch with us](#authors-and-contacts) and we will be more than happy to help. Please do not just wait for us to implement your requirement: we would rather have the real-time feedback about which features are most useful!

## Installation and User Guide

Our user guide is at http://tabbycat.readthedocs.org/.

If you would like to run a tournament with Tabbycat but are not able to set it up, get in touch with [Philip](http://www.google.com/recaptcha/mailhide/d?k=01aItEbHtwnn1PzIPGGM9W8A==&c=XWljk2iGokfhziV2Rt4OiKA5uab1vCrnxwXcPUsWgnM=) and he can setup a private online copy of the software for your use.

## License and Development

We have not released this under an open-source licence (so there is no formal general right to use this software), but if you are running a debating tournament, you are welcome to use it. It would be nice if you could please let us know that you are doing so, and let us know how it went. [Our Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/tabbycat.debate/) is a great place to start. We are happy to help if you have any questions or feature requests although we provide no warranty and disclaim all legal liability.

Pull requests are encouraged and if you are interested in helping out as a developer, we would love to have you! [Join our Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/tabbycat.debate/) and contact us as below.

If you have a GitHub account, we would prefer that **bug reports** be submitted to our [issues page](https://github.com/czlee/tabbycat/issues). Otherwise, feel free to [shoot us an email](#authors-and-contacts).
