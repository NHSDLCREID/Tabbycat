    Room constraints tell the room allocator to try to keep the specified
    team or adjudicator, or all teams (but not adjudicators) from the
    specified institution, in a room in the given category. The "priority"
    field resolves conflicting constraints: the higher priority takes
    precedence. You can also use the priority field to specify
    "lower-preference" constraints, which are taken if a higher-priority
    constraint couldn't be met.
